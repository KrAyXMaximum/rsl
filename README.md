## ‚ö° Overview
### How it works.
Roblox Status Live uses the [Roblox API](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/collected-list-of-apis/557091) endpoints [status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) and [ping times](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/ping) to determine if Roblox is working correctly. We also use other determining factors, such as [Roblox's Official Status page](https://status.roblox.com) to determine if there is an active incident at Roblox.
### Why is it important?
If you are not an active Roblox player or developer, the use of Roblox Status Live may not be very important to you. However if you are a developer, knowing the status of Roblox and it's APIs can help you determine player count, projected revenue, and the lost revenue due to the inability for players to purchase [gamepasses](https://education.roblox.com/en-us/resources/game-passes) or [developer products](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Developer-Products-In-Game-Purchases).
### Why is Roblox Status Live better other automated down detectors?
Well, the answer to this question is more complicated than one may think. For example, people may compare Roblox Status Live to [Status+](https://github.com/Status-Plus). Status+ is a great down detector for Roblox, but we track two completely different things.  

Status+ focuses on tracking FFlags and more intricate details of Roblox APIs (ping times, status codes, etc), while Roblox Status Live attempts to track ping times, status codes, page content, and anything that could relate to a Roblox outage (including the [Official Roblox Status Page](https://status.roblox.com)).

At Roblox Status Live, we are evolving very quickly and plan on using an [Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning engine](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/artificial-intelligence-ai-vs-machine-learning/#introduction) to help determine if Roblox is having an outage, what the outage consists of, and an estimated ETA for a resolution. 

## ü§ñ Roblox Status Live API
